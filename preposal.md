# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I'm doing the games track, so I'd like to do something with editing an already existing game like Pong.
I liked that idea the best based off of 11/5's lecture, and I'm having a rough time this semester,
so I think it will be easiest. I'm still figuring out what game I'd like to edit right now.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I am working alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Nope! I will come to office hours or reach out if needed.
