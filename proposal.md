# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Block Breaker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I am recreating the game of Brick Breaker; the user can break blocks in a Pong-style game by hitting the blocks with a ball.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

As mentioned above, there is one user per game. The user has the ability to control a block that will reflect an incoming ball,
breaking other blocks that are stationary. Some of the stationary blocks will have a difficulty level indicated by color. Once
the user breaks all the blocks, the user wins the game. There will be sounds involved as-well.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Creating the general game where the user controls a brick, hits the ball, and breaks blocks (sounds included).

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding difficulty levels in terms of how many times the blocks need to be hit to be broken. The blocks would be
denoted in difficulty by their color.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Adding difficulty as the game progresses; for example, multiple levels of the game, shortening the user's block as
they break more blocks.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

A lot of these skills are from Pong, and I'm grateful that this project is very flexible. I will need to learn
how to eliminate the blocks from the game and how to count how many blocks have been broken. For the latter step,
I will most likely have a small tracker at the top with something like "Blocks remaining: n "
